This module demonstrates:
 1. MUTATION of an OBJECT via a direct assignment.
 2. MUTATION of an OBJECT via a function call.
 3. Two names that REFER to the same object.
 4. Re-assigning a new to refer to a NEW object.
 5. Two equality operators:   is   ==

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# DONE: 2.
#  Step a:  READ the   mutate_point   function below.
#
#  Step b:  Note that the code in main has 5 parts numbered 1, 2, ... 5.
#    ** For EACH of those 5 parts: **
#
#    Step b1:  READ the code in that part.
#
#    Step b2:  PREDICT what  the code in that part will print
#                when it runs.
#
#    Step b3:  RUN this module and examine the output from that part.
#
#    Step b4:  See whether your prediction matched the actual output.
#                Ask questions as needed to resolve any differences.
#
#    Step b5:  When you believe that you understand ** ALL ** the code
#                in this module, ** ASKING QUESTIONS AS NEEDED, **
#                change the above TO DO to DONE.

# My question to fisher: 
# Why does the first print statement evaluate to True? The variable name x doesn’t seem (to me) to point to the same string instance with value <h e l l o>. I understand why x == y, since their string instances have the same value of <h e l l o>. What is happening in memory? Is there something in Python that just doesn’t bother making another instance of a string if a string with its same value already exists? Does it create a pointer without asking you?

# 
# Similarly, why would binary operations affect the IS evaluation? Why does x IS y evaluate to TRUE in Code Block 2, but not in Code Block 3? (I understand why they wouldn’t have an effect on the == evaluation; if the same operation is applied to both strings, they would have the same value.)
